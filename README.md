Google Business Intelligence Capstone Project: Google Fiber Scenario
---

This is a capstone project that I have completed as part of the [Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence). The Google Business Intelligence Certificate programme builds on the foundations of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) and helps enhance technical skills, including BigQuery, Tableau, and SQL. Course participants can learn the following:

* Explore the roles of business intelligence (BI) professionals within an organization
* Practice data modeling and extract, transform, load (ETL) processes that meet organizational goals 
* Design data visualizations that answer business questions
* Create dashboards that effectively communicate data insights to stakeholders

## Background
I am interviewing for a job with Google Fiber (also GFiber), which provides people and businesses with fibre optic internet. As part of the interview process, the Fiber customer service team has asked me to design a dashboard using fictional data. The position I am interviewing for is in the customer call centre, where Fiber uses business intelligence to monitor and improve customer satisfaction. To provide the interviewers with both BI value and organisational data maturity, I will use my knowledge of the BI stages: Capture, Analyse, and Monitor.

The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers.

## Business Task
To design a dashboard that reveals insights about repeat callers to the Google Fiber customer service team, which will help leaders assess whether the team can respond to customer questions the first time, and how to improve the overall customer experience.

## Guiding Questions
1. How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers?
2. What problem types generate the most repeat calls?
3. Which market cityâ€™s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?

## Tools Used
- Google BigQuery for data integration
- Python (pandas library) for data cleaning and formatting
- Tableau for dashboarding

## Interactive Tableau Dashboard
The interactive Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.poe/viz/GoogleBusinessIntelligenceCapstoneProjectGoogleFiberScenario/GoogleFiberDashboard).

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by Google Fiber, and has been anonymised and approved.

## Conclusion
Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation, this project provides actionable insights into customer call patterns, enabling informed decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency across diverse markets and issue types.
