Google Business Intelligence Capstone Project: Google Fiber Scenario
---

This is a capstone project that I have completed as part of the [Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence). The Google Business Intelligence Certificate programme builds on the foundations of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) and helps enhance technical skills, including BigQuery, Tableau, and SQL. Course participants can learn the following:

* Explore the roles of business intelligence (BI) professionals within an organization
* Practice data modeling and extract, transform, load (ETL) processes that meet organizational goals 
* Design data visualizations that answer business questions
* Create dashboards that effectively communicate data insights to stakeholders

## Background
I am interviewing for a job with Google Fiber (also GFiber), which provides people and businesses with fibre optic internet. As part of the interview process, the Fiber customer service team has asked me to design a dashboard using fictional data. The position I am interviewing for is in the customer call centre, where Fiber uses business intelligence to monitor and improve customer satisfaction. To provide the interviewers with both BI value and organisational data maturity, I will use my knowledge of the BI stages: Capture, Analyse, and Monitor.

The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers.

## Business Task
To design a dashboard that reveals insights about repeat callers to the Google Fiber customer service team, which will help leaders assess whether the team can respond to customer questions the first time, and how to improve the overall customer experience.

## Guiding Questions
1. How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls from customers?
2. What problem types generate the most repeat calls?
3. Which market cityâ€™s customer service team receives the most repeat calls?

## Tools Used
- Google BigQuery for data integration
- Python (pandas library) for data cleaning and formatting
- Tableau for dashboarding

## Interactive Tableau Dashboard
The interactive Tableau dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.poe/viz/GoogleBusinessIntelligenceCapstoneProjectGoogleFiberScenario/GoogleFiberDashboard).

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by Google Fiber, and has been anonymised and approved.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

The key findings of this project are as follows:

- Market city 2 has the best overall FCR rate, while market city 3 has
  the lowest overall FCR rate.
- Market city 1 received the greatest number of repeat calls.
- Most repeat calls were made regarding internet and Wi-Fi, and
  technician troubleshooting problems.
- Market city 1 has an FCR rate below industry standards for scheduling
  problems.
- Market city 3 has FCR rates below industry standards for accounting
  and scheduling problems.

Based on these key findings, I would like to make the following
recommendations:

- Provide more training and support for handling technician
  troubleshooting and internet and WiFi problems.
- Allocate more resources and staff to market_1 to address the higher
  volume of repeat calls.
- Training should be provided to staff in market_3 to equip them better
  to handle account management and scheduling problems.
- Provide additional support to market_1 for staff to handle scheduling
  problems better.

## Conclusion
Through data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation, this project provides actionable insights into customer call patterns, enabling informed decision-making to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency across diverse markets and issue types.
