Google Business Intelligence Capstone Project: Google Fiber Scenario
---

This is a capstone project that I have completed as part of the [Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-business-intelligence). The Google Business Intelligence Certificate programme builds on the foundations of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) and helps enhance technical skills, including BigQuery, Tableau, and SQL. Course participants can learn the following:

* Explore the roles of business intelligence (BI) professionals within an organization
* Practice data modeling and extract, transform, load (ETL) processes that meet organizational goals 
* Design data visualizations that answer business questions
* Create dashboards that effectively communicate data insights to stakeholders

Full details can be found in this [Markdown made using RStudio]().
